                  We were started in 2020 by a U.S. Navy veteran. The pandemic
                  made it hard for people of all walks of life to adjust to the
                  hard times but our veterans always end up with the short end
                  of the stick. This blog is dedicated to helping veterans make
                  a smooth transition from active duty into a second career
                  without the military. Our job is to give you all of the
                  resources and tools you need to find employment during
                  termanil leave or sooner. Some of our resources include:
                  Resume Writing Best Practices, Interview Tips and Job Board
                  Profile set-ups. We pride ourselves in having the most
                  up-to-date information on jobs and career resources.
